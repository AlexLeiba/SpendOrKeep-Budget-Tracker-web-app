This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# Prisma

## npx prisma migrate -

Applies the schema changes.

Creates SQL migration file.

Useful when collaborating or tracking DB changes.
####################################################

## npx prisma migrate reset

Reset DB and reapply all migrations:

####################################################

## npx prisma generate -

This rebuilds the Prisma Client, based on your current schema.

Must run after changing the schema (models, relations, etc.).

It updates the @prisma/client package so your app gets correct types and functions.

####################################################

## npx prisma db push -

This pushes the schema directly to the database — no migrations, just instant sync.

Great for local/dev environments.

Does not create a migration history.

Super useful after manual DB resets.
